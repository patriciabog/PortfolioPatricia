        "harryPotterDescription": " This is a bootcamp evaluation project at Adalab where I had to apply what I learned about React and using APIs. The challenge I faced was understanding lifting state up and the connection between the parent and the children, and how they passed information to each other. It's quite simple: from child to child, they cannot directly exchange information; you have to inform the parent first and then let the parent decide whether to share that information with the other child. That's what lifting state up is all about.",
        "awsomeCardsDescription": "This is a real bootcamp team project where I applied JavaScript and CSS/SASS in practice while working under an Agile and Scrum system. The biggest challenge I encountered was resolving conflicts during commits to the master branch. However, this challenge was overcome through fluid team communication.",
        "guessNumberDescription": "This project was one of the initial bootcamp assessments involving JavaScript and CSS. The most significant challenge was completing it within a single morning, with just one week of learning JavaScript. Thanks to Stack Overflow and a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts needed for its application, my game worked!"
